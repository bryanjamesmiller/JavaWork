Please refer to the below emails.  In summary, Harvard Extension School can't confirm my enrollment for next semester until I register, which I can't do until July when registration begins.  At that time I can give a letter of enrollment.  If you would like to contact Rebecca from Harvard below, feel free.  I am planning on continuing at Harvard Extension school this fall as planned.  In fact, I will likely apply for another loan from you for the fall semester.

Thanks,

Bryan Miller


Dear Mr. Miller,

When you register for courses, you should receive a registration confirmation email. We recommend that you explain our verification policies to your lender and provide them with the registration confirmation before we can officially confirm enrollment. Please feel free to forward the information I gave you to any institution. You can also give them our contact information.

Best regards,

Thanks for the information.  What is your recommendation for me to do with Wells Fargo because it appears to only concern enrolling for next semester?  Do you mind if I forward them your email below?

Dear Mr. Miller,

Thank you for your email. Since Harvard Extension School is open enrollment, and different in its enrollment verification policies from traditional schools, students often encounter this confusion with their lenders. Due to the open enrollment nature of the Harvard Extension School, we can only certify enrollment on a semester by semester basis. For each semester, we are able to officially confirm enrollment once the final course and credit status changes deadline (50% refund deadline) has passed. Up until that date, a student can completely drop the course from his or her record. You should take note of these dates on the website calendar.
 
Each semester, we automatically and electronically submit students' registration information to the National Student Clearinghouse. This submission takes place after the final course and credit status changes deadline, and reoccurs periodically throughout the semester. If your lender participates with the National Student Clearinghouse, they can obtain your enrollment information electronically this way. Because we can only certify enrollment on a semester by semester basis, in between semesters, no enrollment information would be sent, so your lender might interpret this as you no longer continuing your studies with us.

Hi Rebecca,


Thank you for the information.  I just wanted to email to try to explain the situation because it's kind of confusing and hard to do over the phone.  I took out a Wells Fargo/USAA private student loan to help me pay for prerequisite courses and pre-admissions courses.  When I took out the loan, they said it was fine that I wouldn't be graduating until 2019 and my loan documents say the same thing.  However, for some reason they think I'm either graduating or stopping classes this semester.  I think it's perhaps because enrollment doesn't start until July for the Fall semester so perhaps they don't get that, but that's just my guess.


In any case, would you be able to send them some kind of verification that I don't currently plan to stop school or graduate until 2019?  I'm fine with calling to confirm this request with you, but I just want to try to explain this information as clearly as possible to get the right information sent because it's pretty confusing to me, at least.  Also, what information will I need to provide via fax or over the phone to confirm this verification request?


I should also mention that I'm not yet an admitted student to the program (ALM-IT), but this is why I had to take the private student loan out in the first place rather than getting a Federal loan.


Thanks again for all your help,


Bryan Miller
